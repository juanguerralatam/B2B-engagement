H7faxHY1ykg,AWS Founder Spotlight: WRITER | Amazon Web Services,"In ten years‚Äô time there will be two types of companies: AI-first companies and dead companies. May Habib, CEO and Co-founder of WRITER predicts a future in which generative AI has disrupted ‚Äúthe whole idea of software,‚Äù and envisions an enterprise landscape where ‚Äúthe processes that we supervise as humans, that we orchestrate at work, will be supported by a hierarchy of tools and user interfaces of increasing flexibility and ephemerality.‚Äù This new landscape of AI tools will shorten the distance between conception and reality and expand what people and businesses believe is possible.
 
WRITER is one such AI-first company, offering an end-to-end platform that helps enterprises build, launch, and supervise their own AI agents. In providing an accessible, ready-to-use toolset, it‚Äôs democratizing agentic AI and enabling its customers to work more efficiently, productively, and creatively. In doing so, WRITER is helping businesses to become AI-first success stories.
 
WRITER partnered with AWS, training and deploying the models that underpin its platform using solutions such as Amazon SageMaker HyperPod and Amazon Bedrock. The company‚Äôs ability to offer serverless models in Amazon Bedrock and the decision to run its infrastructure on AWS ‚Äúis a big part of why we can sell and punch way above our weight,‚Äù says Habib. Since the partnership began in 2024, WRITER has scaled its business from a startup to a major player serving market-leading names. ‚ÄúBecause of our relationship with AWS,‚Äù says Habib, ‚Äúwe've been able to really go to market and surround some of the biggest companies in the Fortune 500 with an end-to-end enterprise offering for generative AI.

AWS Transform addresses the key challenges of mainframe modernization by providing a guided, human controlled, expert-driven approach. It tackles the hurdle of understanding large, complex mainframe codebases by using Generative AI and automation to analyze the applications and break down monolithic structures into modular domains. To address the need for deep expertise across both mainframe and cloud systems, AWS Transform taps into decades of accumulated modernization best practices. It combines Generative AI and a domain-specific knowledge base to guide users through the transformation process. This enables organizations to transition to cloud-native architectures efficiently supplementing in-house expertise, while improving security, availability, and agility. By automating and streamlining the assessment, planning, and execution phases, AWS Transform significantly reduces the timeline of mainframe application modernization. This empowers customers to innovate faster while mitigating the risks associated with modifying legacy applications. AWS Transform automation simplifies the modernization journey, enabling customers to focus on strategic priorities while AWS Transform handles the complex, labor-intensive tasks.

NdpUnyf4bl8,Declarative Policies for EC2 | Amazon Web Services,"New organization management policy type that allows you to declare and enforce desired configuration for a given AWS service in your environment. As the name suggests you simply declare the configuration you want and AWS takes care of ensuring it is true. Once set, it PREVENTS non compliant actions. For example, let‚Äôs say you want to ensure VPC BPA, you simply create a declarative policy that sets VPC Block Public Access= Bidirectional with a few clicks or commands. Once set, regardless of whether a principal tries to egress out of your VPC, or you have an API Gateway endpoint that supports public access or have an Internet Gateway, none of those actions will be allowed. Declarative policies simplify enforcing desired configuration.

Easy to Use: With Declarative Policies, customers can define desired configuration outcome using English-like statements with a few simple clicks or commands. 

Set once and Forget: The configuration defined in the Declarative Policy is always maintained, even when AWS services introduce new APIs, new accounts are added to an Organization and new principals and resources get created. Non-compliant actions fail regardless of whether they were invoked by a principal or a service using an SLR.

Transparent: Declarative Policies support customizable error messages, which allow administrators to redirect end users to internal wiki pages and other resources. This reduces end-user frustration.

MrD9tCNpOvU,Agentic AI Design Patterns Introduction and walkthrough | Amazon Web Services,"The video explores four foundational design patterns in agentic AI systems: reflection, tool use, planning, and multi-agent collaboration. These patterns represent the evolution of AI from basic problem-solving to sophisticated autonomous systems capable of making complex decisions with minimal human oversight. Through practical examples using Amazon Bedrock, the video demonstrates how AI agents can self-evaluate, utilize external tools, break down complex tasks, and collaborate effectively. The presentation emphasizes how these patterns enable AI systems to work independently and cooperatively while adapting to various challenges, ultimately transforming traditional work processes and industry operations through enhanced decision-making capabilities.

ALWUN7WgW0E,Cost Optimization of RDS instances - Schedule start and stop | Amazon Web Services,"When thinking of the cost optimization of your cloud usage, scheduling the start and stop of Amazon RDS instances is valuable because it allows organizations to automatically shut down databases during periods of inactivity‚Äîsuch as nights or weekends‚Äîthereby reducing compute costs since you are not billed for DB instance hours while the instance is stopped. This approach is especially beneficial for development and test environments, ensuring that resources are only running (and incurring compute charges) when actually needed, while still retaining storage and backup data for quick reactivation. In this video, I demonstrate how to setup IAM, AWS Resource Groups and AWS Systems Manager to automate the startup and the shutdown events of your RDS instances.

hPHFcTH8mD8,Dymocks: Turning the Page on Bookstore Innovation | Retail Insights with AWS | Amazon Web Services,"Step into the heart of Sydney, where the familiar scent of fresh pages welcomes you into a Dymocks bookstore. For more than 140 years, Dymocks has been a beloved destination for readers, a place where stories are discovered and communities are formed. But as the world of bookselling changes, Dymocks is writing a new chapter‚Äîone where tradition and technology walk hand in hand.

In this episode of ""Retail Insights with AWS,"" hosts Isha Dalal and Claudia Howlett invite you behind the scenes with Will Sanderson (Group CIO, Dymocks) and Chafic Abdallah (Head of Architecture and Transformation), the leaders guiding Dymocks through its transformation. The story begins with a question: how does a classic bookstore stay relevant in a digital-first era?

The answer unfolds in the seamless blend of the physical and digital. Dymocks‚Äô click-and-collect and in-store ordering services now connect readers to their next great read, whether they‚Äôre browsing online or wandering the aisles. The modernization of Dymocks‚Äô product information management systems has made it possible to showcase their vast collection more efficiently and accurately, both online and in-store. Modern inventory systems ensure that every book lover can find what they‚Äôre searching for, while the franchise model preserves the unique character of each store and strengthens connections to local communities.

Through technology, Dymocks has reimagined the bookstore without losing its soul. Community events, author talks, and reading groups continue to thrive both in-store and online, proving that innovation can enhance‚Äînot replace‚Äîthe joy of discovery and human connection.

Join us as we explore Dymocks‚Äô journey, and see how this iconic bookseller is keeping the wonder of bookstores alive while embracing the future of retail.
