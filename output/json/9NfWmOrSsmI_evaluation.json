    "score": 0.78,
    "explanation": "The transcript is clear and coherent, with a logical flow that introduces AWS Marketplace's benefits for AI agents. It effectively communicates the value proposition and key features, such as centralized billing and management. However, the engagement and storytelling quality could be improved by incorporating more vivid language or examples to make the content more relatable. The professional presentation is strong, but the educational value is somewhat limited by the lack of deeper insights or specific use cases.",
